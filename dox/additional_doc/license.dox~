Usage: siitool [-h] [-v] [-p] [-o outfile] [filename]\n\n
	-h         print this help and exit\n
	-v         print version an exit
	-o <name>  write output to file <name>\n
	-p         print content human readable\n
	filename   path to eeprom file, if missing read from stdin\n
	Recognized file types: SII and ESI/XML.\n

\example sii_example.bin
In this example we will read the sii_example.bin binary file and output it in a human readable syntax in our terminal:\n\n

./siitool -p examples/sii_example.bin\n\n

sii_example is a binary file not suitable for human reading:\n\n

\example Somanet_CtrlProto.xml
In this example we will transform the Somanet_CtrlProto.xml definition file into a binary output:\n\n

./siitool examples/Somanet_CtrolProto.xml\n\n

This file is a simple ESI for use with controlproto. Features:
	- no mailbox
	- single set of predefined PDOs\n\n


\example Somanet_CiA402-single.xml
In this example we will transform the Somanet_CiA402-single.xml definition file into a binary output and we will save it into a file:\n\n

./siitool -o cia402_single examples/Somanet_CiA402-single.xml\n\n

This file is a simple CiA402 ESI. Features:
	- Mailbox
	- single set of predefined PDOs\n\n

\example Somanet_CiA402-multi.xml
In this example we will transform the  Somanet_CiA402-multi.xml definition file into a binary output, we will save it into a file, and a human friendly description will be shown on the terminal:\n\n

./siitool -p -o cia402_single examples/Somanet_CiA402-single.xml\n\n

This definition file is a more complex CiA402 ESI which supports a set of PDOs for various CiA402 modes. Features:
	- Mailbox
	- multiple PDOs\n\n
